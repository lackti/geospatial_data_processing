# geospatial_data_processing  
This project is an order from a Phd Student  
The data is a shapefile (points) and 2 folders containing rasters  
The first one containing depth rasters and second one containing the velocity rasters 
The task is basically :  
to calculate for each point in the shapefile, the velocity and depth values and R value  
The problem is there's huge amount of data  
So to calculate the above values there's some rules to follow
