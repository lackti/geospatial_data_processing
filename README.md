# geospatial_data_processing  
### This project is an order from a Phd Student  
The giving data are  :
- A **shapefile (points)**    
- A folder containing the depth rasters  
- A folder containing the velocity rasters   

The task is basically :   

to calculate for each point in the shapefile, the velocity and depth values and R value  
The problem is there's huge amount of data  
So to calculate the above values there's some rules to follow
