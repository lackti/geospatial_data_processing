# geospatial_data_processing  
### This project is an order from a Phd Student  
The giving data are  :
- **A folder containing a point shapefile**    
- **A folder containing the depth rasters**   
- **A folder containing the velocity rasters**   

### The task is basically :   

To calculate for each point in the shapefile, the velocity and depth values and R value  
The R value is calculated based on conditions  
There's huge amount of data to caluculate    
The flowchart below explain well the work flow
